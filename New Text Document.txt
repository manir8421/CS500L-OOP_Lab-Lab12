Instead of defining your own state classes, you will use the "state_machine module" introduced in the class.
Begin by creating a class named "VendingProcess" to encapsulate the states and transitions that will define
the vending machine's state machine. Subsequently, rewrite your vending_machine class. To test your classes,
use the same main function from the previous question.

Here's a summary of steps:

1. Encapsulate states and transitions in VendingProcess class: Create a class named "VendingProcess"
that encapsulates the states and transitions defining the vending machine's state machine.
2. Rewrite vending_machine class: Rewrite the vending_machine class to incorporate the state_machine
module and the VendingProcess class.
3. Utilize existing main function for testing: Employ the same main function from the previous question to
test the newly implemented classes.
